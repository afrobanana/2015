  Why not get your friends together to make the most of the drive down to the festival? Sharing a ride is fun, will save you petrol money, and it will be easier for everyone to park once on site!  When you approach the festival site, please follow the signs and the parking assistantsâ€™ signals as they guide you toward the designated parking area. Try not to leave your car on the main road to avoid congestion and potential accidents.
