  We’ve got you covered when the hunger pangs kick in! A wide variety of food will be available on the festival crowds, with tantalising flavours dished up by select food stalls (including vegan delights).
  We’ll also be quenching your thirst with special cocktails created by professional mixologists especially for the occasion. Don’t fancy alcohol? Refreshing iced teas and frappes should give you the energy boost you need to keep you on your toes all night long.
