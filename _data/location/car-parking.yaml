  If you are bringing your own car, please remember: &ldquo;The more the merrier&rdquo;. Invite your friends and share the ride. When you get near the Festival site, please follow the signs and the parking assistants&rsquo; signals to the predefined parking area. Avoid leaving your car in the main road to avoid congestion and potential accidents.
