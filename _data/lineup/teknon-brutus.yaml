  A force to be reckoned with, Teknon Brutus is all about shaking up the party with ecstatic techno house electro acid grooves. This Cypriot-Chillian DJ has been keeping busy in the hub of Berlin’s music scene for over a decade (with parties at hot spots like PHASE where he is also a resident), while he’s also about to release a new record on with the African Shakedown label. He’s now set to take crowds on a musical journey that has the drive of techno, the melody and romance of disco and the infectious groove of funk. Expect pure raw sound and intense emotion. After all, for this DJ, it’s all about connecting with the universal consciousness and becoming one through music.
