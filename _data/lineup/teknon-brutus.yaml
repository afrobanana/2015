  A force to be reckoned with, Teknon Brutus is all about shaking up the party with ecstatic Disco-Techno grooves with a dash of inspiration from hip-hop, funk, and Latin beats.

  This Cypriot-Chillian DJ has been keeping busy in the hub of Berlin’s music scene for over a decade (with parties at hot spots like the Golden Gate and PHASE), while he’s also about to release a new record on with the African Shakedown label. He’s now set to take crowds on a musical journey that has the drive of techno, the melody and romance of disco and the infectious groove of funk.
