  A recently formed Cyprus based DJ duo, Cotsios O Picatillis and Mr. Fox, are known by party animals for their flamboyant mixing style and eclectic selections, ranging from disco to techno and everything and anything in between.

  Their project was born out of their mutual love for dance music across genres, coupled with a belief that dancing is an important form of human expression that is often overlooked in modern day society. Prepare for an explosive dance floor experience with plenty of spicy surprises in the mix.
