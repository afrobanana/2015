  This is one dude that will have you grooving and moving in ways beyond your wildest imagination, as Far Eastern Psych meets Left Field Worldbeat. Jetting in for the festival from Geneva, itâ€™s all about crazy vintage sounds and obscure grooves from Asia and beyond. Collecting records and DJing for over 20 years, ha has been a resident DJ at various venues in Geneva such as the Madone Bar, Shark, L'Etage and promoter at Zoo-Usine, where he focused on art performance and experimental music.

  After many countless trips to the Far East, he has has sharpened his globe-spanning mix with far eastern psychedelic music and with largely unheard gems from across the musical spectrum. In the past couple of years, The Dude of Stratosphear has been a regular guest at Zudrangma's parties "Isan Dancehall" in Bangkok while having played at countless other clubs around the world.
