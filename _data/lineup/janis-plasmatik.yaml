  Not many will need an introduction to Janis Plasmatik, who has played alongside the likes of Sammy Dee, Sonja Moonear, Vera, Daniel Bell, Rhadoo and Petre Inspirescu, Jan krueger and more during his tenancy as klubd’s artistic director.

  A visionary selector who likes to dig and dive into the deeper textures of music, he recently played at legendary Athens club, six d.o.g.s, while this summer he’ll be heading over (or will it have passed by this point) to Berlin for a gig at CDV.
