  The Greek Anima Nation keep busy with their performances infused with reggae, ska, funk, Afro beat, Cumbria, Latin and Calypso grooves, fused with a dose of hip hop and soul.

  With countless live performances under their belt, theyâ€™ve been working their magic at top events and festivals alongside the likes of Groundation, Don Carlos, Nneka, Oghene Kolomgbo and Dreadzone.
