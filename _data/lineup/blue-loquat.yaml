  Blue Loquat is a live duo whose music relies on the delicate balancing act between various, often opposing, elements. This is reflected in their sound, as well as in their live performance. Musically, Blue Loquat experiments with form through the juxtaposition of various genres and musical aesthetics, taking the crowd through a rollercoaster of emotional states. While the performance explores the relationship between live music and the dance floor, the duo uses electric guitars, bass guitar, analogue synthesizers and vocals to create a unique live performance, merging the atmosphere of a live concert with a full on club experience.
