  The French Balaphonics brass band promise to keep crowds on their toes with their uplifting Afrobeat, Highlife, Bikutsi, Maloya, Soukous and Ethiopic rhythms and melodies.

  Mainly Influenced by the music of Ghana, Senegal, Mali or Madagascar, audiences can expect the signature Balaphonics blend of syncopated rhythms and great melodies. The group is a mix of percussion, brass and balafon.
