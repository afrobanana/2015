  This Interactive Community ABR Radio, can best be summed us as super fun, entertaining, quirky, unexpected, and more than anything, downright hilarious as local artists come together for some unconventional conceptual radio shows.

  Born from the idea of giving festival goers a bit of extra entertainment during the day, between acts and activities, it then grew to become a special event in itself. Prepare to be entertained in a way that only the ABR knows. So expect the unexpected and hold tight...it has a reputation of being a bit playful so donâ€™t always take what it is says for granted (or literally for that matter!).
