  This Israeli instrumental post-funk band have been delivering genre melting infectious grooves for over a decade and they sure know how to do it with exceptional artistry and brilliance.

  The musicians’ inspired chemistry and varied backgrounds allow them to infuse the indigenous rhythms of the Middle East and the melodies of European Jewish heritage, with American R’n’B, jazz, and hip-hop traditions, enhancing them with dubbed out effects, often within the same track.  Expect decks, horns, double bass, drums and tape effects. Enough said!
