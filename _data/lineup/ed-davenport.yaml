  Based in Berlin, the 29-year-old British Ed Davenport has slowly but surely carved out his very own niche, while working up a name for himself in the electronic music scene of the German capital and beyond.

  He now runs his own label, Counterchange Recordings, co-runs the historic Infrastructure New York imprint with Function, and also releases music under his Inland guise. Driven by a sense of the timelessness of great music, Ed continues to hone a sound that is simultaneously emotional, engaging, and expansive.
