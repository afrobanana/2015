  Crowds around the island regularly party to Cusack’s cool electronic beats but now many know that his love affair with this type of music began at a prepubescent stage in the mid 80s after hearing Kraftwerk’s ‘Tour de France’ whilst insistently watching ‘Breakdance - The Movie’ at the age of nine. Following regular visits to the UK, the rave scene in the early 90s left a lasting impression, and Cusack soon found himself living in London. Beguiled by the city’s underground party circuit and clubs like 'Lost' and 'The End', he soon began amassing records, drum machines and precious stones. One night whilst in a lucid trance-like state, Cusack encountered the twin apparition of Larry Levan and David Mancuso teaching him the ways of the force. Years later you can hear him spinning anything from freaky Chicago Acid Trax and dreamy Detroit techno, to Synth-pop, New Wave, Deep-House and Disco. Are you ready to be whisked away with wild and wonderful beats? Cusack certainly is!
