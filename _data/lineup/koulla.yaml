  Koulla P. Katsikoronou grooves in a loose, freewheel fashion, injecting her delicious ‘nuggets’ straight into your dancing shoes!

  That’s right, this is one DJ who loves to tease the crowds with a little quirky mystery, and absolutely loves to do her (or his!) thing behind the decks under various guises and pseudonyms, exciting the crowds at numerous bars and hip and happening events island-wide with tropical global sounds.

  When he isn’t getting the party started at a wild party as a DJ, he's recognized well beyond our island's shores for his brilliant musical talent as part of the well-known Cyprus folk band, Monsieur Doumani.
