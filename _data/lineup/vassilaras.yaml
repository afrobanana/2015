  For Valisis, music is comparable to mouth to mouth with the world! And let’s just say, it’s what keeps him ticking!

  A music producer at Radio Proto (Dias), with a steady 3 hour radio show on Sunday nights from 9-12, he also keeps busy DJing at local bars and events around Nicosia, Limassol, and Paphos.  From acid jazz, Afro funk, reggae and ska grooves, he knows certainly how to foster an atmosphere of elation on the dance floor.
