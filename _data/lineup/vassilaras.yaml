  For Vassilis, music is comparable to mouth to mouth with the world! And let’s just say, it’s what keeps him ticking! A former music producer at Radio Proto (Dias), he now keeps busy DJing at local bars and events around Nicosia, Limassol, and Paphos.  From acid jazz, Afro funk, reggae and ska grooves, he knows certainly how to foster an atmosphere of elation on the dance floor.
