  Born in London but brought up in Cyprus, Mpakalli's first foray into the electronic music scene was organizing and promoting events of all genres across the island. However, it took a return to his birthplace London for him to find his musical epiphany, weaned on a diet of tech house and minimal as he started DJing as ‘Simply Nick’ at various underground parties and hosting rooms in mega clubs such as Turnmills. After experiencing the evolution of EDM in numerous countries from Berlin to Montreal, ‘Simply Nick’ returned to CY  now performs at various bars and festivals islandwide as ‘Mpakkalis’ island, combining a mixture of UK tech house and nu disco, serving up a variety of techy beats designed to get your groove on!
