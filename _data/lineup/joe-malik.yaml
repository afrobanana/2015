  Joe Malik is the DJ persona of Pandelis Diamantides; a musician, sound designer and visual artist.

  When he’s not busy programming audio installations for the Marina Abramovic Institute, designing Augmented Reality applications for the Appril Festival or in his studio producing audiovisual work for Microseq, he loves to experiment with DJ-ing with dub-techno, electronic, breakbeats and experimental. But that’s not all! When there’s a projector around, he likes to combine audio selectives with generative visuals, produced live by custom software that he has developed in recent years, aiming at an advance combination of DJ-ing and VJ-ing.
