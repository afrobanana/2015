  Hailing from Cyprus, Kineza has spent the past few years shifting her knowledge of composing to the underrated art of mixing, or curating, music.

  Having played alongside Randomer and LONE, she presents the  finest of whatever the affair calls for - whether itâ€™s for the two lone survivors of an after party or to the masses of a dancefloor. Exploring the relationship between genres, anything goes; from deep electronic beats to etheric bleeps and tribal rhythms, for the intuitive sake of mood. Known for making crowds dance on table tops, suffice to say the journey is rather unique.
