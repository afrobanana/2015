  Giving Bucharest and cities around Romania an extra buzz with his characteristic mix of late disco, Afro disco, disco edits, Italo disco, early house and eclectic electronic, Carantino will be arriving in Cyprus to continue the party atmosphere, seriously spiced up by world beats and African drums. It was the love for Disco and related genres, that led him to a residentship at one of the major clubs from Bucharest, Control Club, where he has shared the booth with DJs like Cristian Pannenborg, Marcello Giordani, Discodromo, Horse Meat Disco, Franz UnderWear, Manuel Kim, Montezumas Rache, Sergio Rizzolo.
