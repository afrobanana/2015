  The Afro Banana Republic is an annual Community Festival, organised by a mix of creative talents who are part of the Festival's team. With a mix of professionals from different fields on board, the team derives its inspiration from the creative art scene in Cyprus.

  Taking on a multidisciplinary approach, the occasion provides a platform for a whole host of home grown talents to explore their potential within this Community, presenting their work as part of a whole while becoming collectively stronger, gaining acknowledgement around the island and beyond.

  Since its inception, the festival has grown from strength to strength, recently honoured with the EFFE Label 2015-2016, earning international recognition as one of Europeâ€™s finest festivals. The whole occasion bears the creative stamp of the "ABR - Alternative Brains Rule" non-profit organisation.
